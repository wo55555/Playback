## [0.2.0-mc26.20] - 2026-08-18

### Highlights

- Added an in-game cinematic camera workflow with position, yaw, pitch, roll, FOV, multiple interpolation modes, live preview, and dimension-aware track segmentation.
- Added experimental frame-by-frame export to H.264 MP4 through bundled FFmpeg or to PNG image sequences, with configurable tick range, frame rate, resolution, SSAA, and warm-up frames.
- Reworked replay rendering so preview and export share the same camera timeline, entity-pose sampling, observer synchronization, and cross-dimension state machine.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed compatibility branches for older action payload layouts. Replay archives created by previous Playback releases are incompatible and must be recorded again.
- Kept the configuration version in `Config.h` and the recording-file snapshot context version at `1`; no configuration or replay migration layer is provided.

### Added

- Added camera creation, capture-at-playhead, keyframe movement and editing, sequence binding, selection, property inspection, and undo/redo.
- Added Smooth, Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Ease In/Out, Hold, Hermite, and Cubic Bezier camera interpolation.
- Added MP4 and PNG-sequence export progress, cancellation, finalization, output-path validation, and clear-frame retry handling.
- Added D3D11 and D3D12 framebuffer capture paths. D3D12 supports SSAA 1x/2x; D3D11 uses the stable 1x path.
- Added export-time scene readiness checks, camera-driven observer/chunk tracking, and stable-frame warm-up after fast movement or dimension changes.

### Changed

- Flattened the source tree into recording, replay, editor, state, keyframe, exporting, visuals, runtime, packet, and I/O domains.
- Made every recorded dimension change an interpolation boundary. Camera curves never connect across a dimension transition, including when an intermediate dimension has no keyframes.
- Made paused replay use the freely movable observer camera, while active keyframe preview/export uses the sampled timeline camera.
- Unified entity rendering around one sampled pose per frame and temporarily suppresses native movement interpolation during export rendering.
- Set the product version to `0.2.0` and the MC 26.10 release identifier to `v0.2.0-mc26.10`.

### Fixed

- Fixed preview and export stalls when entering, revisiting, or leaving dimensions.
- Fixed forced-snapshot reader boundaries being considered export-ready before the next replay chunk was applied.
- Fixed camera paths loading or capturing the wrong chunk region during fast movement and cross-dimension export.
- Fixed high-speed player ghosting caused by native and replay render paths observing different interpolated positions.
- Fixed free-camera translation stutter, pause rebound, third-person offsets, mouse grab/release loops, and unnecessary pause-time server teleports.
- Fixed raw camera FOV units, D3D11 supersampling fallback, D3D12 clear-frame recovery, and SSAA values above the stable 2x limit.

### Known Limitations

- Video export does not include audio.
- Editor projects are currently in-memory only and are not persisted between replay sessions.
- Camera regions must exist in recorded replay data; Playback cannot reconstruct chunks that were never recorded.
- Old replays whose forced dimension snapshots contain no chunks use a compatibility path until their timeline chunk packets arrive.

## [0.1.2-mc26.20] - 2026-08-03

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the replay metadata and snapshot stream to require per-chunk dimension/view context, explicit local-player creation, and forced snapshot boundaries. Replays created by `v0.1.1` or earlier are not compatible and must be recorded again after upgrading.
- Kept the internal `Config` version field at its initial value (`1`) and left third-party dependency version declarations unchanged. No configuration or replay migration path is provided.

### Added

- Added replay-browser search, playable/unavailable filters, five sorting modes, grid/details views, import, rename, multi-selection deletion, path copying, and File Explorer integration.
- Added replay thumbnail capture into `icon.png` and thumbnail display in the browser on both D3D11 and D3D12.
- Added in-memory editor groundwork for sequence and world-actor segment operations, camera-track data and keyframes, and undo/redo. Project persistence and video export remain unavailable.
- Added D3D11 rendering support for the native replay UI alongside the existing D3D12 path.

### Changed

- Replaced the resource-pack-based replay browser with a native ImGui browser while retaining a lightweight resource-pack button on the main menu.
- Rebuilt the existing replay editor around resizable viewport, details, and timeline panels, zoomable tracks, viewport maximize/restore, and revised transport controls.
- Refactored replay snapshots to carry dimension context and local-player state explicitly, and to force snapshot playback at dimension boundaries.
- Unified command, replay-browser, and editor messages through the English and Simplified Chinese catalogs using LeviLamina's native translation path.
- Bundled the Lucide icon font directly with the mod and reduced the UI resource pack to its main-menu button, bilingual label, and required metadata.
- Consolidated the feature overview in the root README files and replaced the legacy documentation tree with focused installation and source-build guides.

### Fixed

- Restored installed and standalone `playback-ui.mcpack` packaging so the main-menu button is available in complete mod installations and as a separate Release asset.
- Reworked cross-dimension recording and replay handling to close the source chunk at the tick boundary, wait for the target dimension, and apply a dimension-scoped forced snapshot.
- Prevented ordinary forward seeks from reloading snapshots and moving the viewer; snapshot reloads remain for backward seeks, dimension changes, and forced boundaries.
- Improved replay snapshot cleanup and chunk application by refreshing the replay player, isolating chunks by dimension, filtering unsuccessful subchunk responses, and clearing recorded objectives between snapshots.
- Expanded D3D12 command-queue and swap-chain capture to cover additional renderer creation paths.

## [0.1.1-mc26.20] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Adapted to Minecraft 26.20.4

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Bundled the Playback UI resource pack with the mod so LeviLauncher and Lip installations load it automatically through LeviLamina.
- Kept `playback-ui.mcpack` available as a standalone release asset for manual import.

  > **This release changes installation packaging only. The replay format and replay runtime behavior are unchanged from `0.1.0-alpha.1`.**

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Client-side recording with asynchronous replay storage and export.
- Main-menu replay browser and isolated replay-world loading.
- Replay timeline controls for pause, seek, speed, and exit.
- Chunk snapshots, cached chunk replay, entity movement, and selected game-packet replay.
- English and Simplified Chinese localization for commands, the replay editor, and the resource-pack UI.

  > **This is the first public test release. Replay files and behavior may change before `1.0.0`.**
  > **Playback currently targets Windows x64 and the LeviLamina `26.10.*` client runtime.**
