# Third-Party Notices

Playback uses the following third-party projects. Their licenses remain with their respective copyright holders.

| Project | Version or range | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [LeviLamina](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) | `26.10.*` | LGPL-3.0 for non-closed-source portions |
| [SymbolProvider](https://github.com/LiteLDev/SymbolProvider) | `1.2.0` (via LeviLamina) | Public Domain statement in source; no standalone license file |
| [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) | `1.92.7` | MIT |
| [libzip](https://github.com/nih-at/libzip) | `1.11.4` | BSD-3-Clause |
| [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) | `1.1.1w` | OpenSSL and SSLeay licenses |
| [stduuid](https://github.com/mariusbancila/stduuid) | `1.2.3` | MIT |
| [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) | `0.8.3` | BSD-2-Clause |
| [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) | `7.1` | GPL-3.0-or-later for the bundled `--enable-gpl --enable-version3` build |

The complete Dear ImGui, FFmpeg, and x264 license texts are distributed in `licenses/`. Other dependencies are resolved by xmake from their upstream packages; consult each linked project for its complete license text and source code. Playback packages the Xmake-built FFmpeg command-line executable under `tools/ffmpeg.exe`; the pinned build recipe enables x264 and is reproducible from this repository's `xmake.lua` and the linked upstream source releases.

Playback does not redistribute `LeviLamina.dll` or LeviMC's closed-source components. The LeviLamina repository provides `COPYING` and `COPYING.LESSER` for its LGPL-3.0 portions, while `EULA.en.md` and `EULA.zh.md` cover LeviMC closed-source software such as PreLoader and PeEditor.

The SymbolProvider repository contains no `LICENSE`, `COPYING`, `NOTICE`, or `DISCLAIMER.PD` file, and its xmake-repo package recipe does not declare a license. Its sole source file states that it has no assigned copyright and is placed in the Public Domain, while referring to a `DISCLAIMER.PD` file that is not present in the repository. This notice records the upstream state and is not a substitute for legal advice.
